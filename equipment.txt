fishPoleDesc = "A long, elastic rod used by fishermen to catch fish by manipulating a line ending in a hook.\n" +
"At its simplest form, a fishing rod is a straight stick or pole with a line attached to one end.\n" +
"Modern rods, however, generally have the line stored on a reel mounted at the rod handle which controls the line retrieval, " +
"as well as line-guiding swivels that reduce tangling.\n" + 
"To better entice fish, bait or lures are dressed on one or more hooks attached to the line and a bite indicator is used, " +
"some of which might be incorporated as part of the rod itself.\n" +
"Fishing using a rod & reel is considered one of the most sustainable fishing methods, as non-targeted species (called bycatch) " +
"can be released immediately."

shovelDesc = "This fishing method, developed long ago by the indigenous people of Arctic Alaska, the IÃ±upiat, \n" +
"requires little technology, but a great deal of cleverness.\n" +
"It is a very simple and effective way to catch large numbers of fish which, " +
"in the past, were needed not only to feed people, but also their many dogs."

castNetDesc = "A casting net, also called a throw net, is a net used for fishing.\n" +
"It is a circular net with small weights distributed around its edge.\n" +
"The net is cast or thrown by hand in such a manner that it spreads out while it's in the air, before it sinks into the water."=

explosivesDesc = "Blast fishing, when dynamite or other explosives are used to stun or kill fish, " +
"is a practice used in many villages and isolated regions of the world.\n" +
"Hundreds of fish can be seen strewn across the reef left as bycatch, such as the tropical fish in Thailand."

trawlDesc = "One of the most widely used commercial fishing methods.\n" +
"Trawling is performed in many ways, in depths of water ranging from just a few meters to 1600 meters.\n" +
"Trawling is a method of fishing that involves pulling a fishing net through the water behind one or more boats.\n" +
"The net used for trawling is called a trawl.\n" +
"This principle requires netting bags which are towed through water to catch different species of fishes, " +
"or sometimes, targeted species."

powerCatamaranDesc = "Boat Length: 25 to 40 feet\n" +
"Construction: Usually fiberglass, sometimes aluminum twin-hull design\n" +
"Description: Twin deep-V hull sponsons connected by a wide deck differentiate this design from a mono-hull.\n" +
"Desirable for its soft ride. Includes a cockpit and a console or cabin, often configured much like a center-console.\n" +
"Propulsion: Twin outboards\n"
"Purpose: Usually nearshore and offshore fishing, but adaptable to inshore waters, depending on size and rigging"
